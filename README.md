Crop weed detection system is used for identifying the unwanted plants called weeds. These unwanted plants grow rapidly around the crops and contaminate the harvesting. These weeds can also attract pests and fungi. To prevent and curb their growth farmers tend to spray chemicals like weedicides and herbicides. The consumption of these chemicals can be extremely hazardous for the crops and for humans as well. Therefore a I have built an ML model which can identify the weed, crop and soil from a given image. This model can be used in the system where we want to automate the task of spraying weedicides and also save the crops from unwanted spraying of harmful chemicals.
